**APEX - The AnyChain Personal Exchange** is an open source project (MPL 2.0) designed to allow Owners to connect, communicate and transact with any blockchain, owner or service on their terms from their phone. Our mission is to empower people to command their personal economies through monetizing their digital goods (podcasts/ebooks/blogs/videos/etc.), digital assets (crypto/NFTs/etc.), physical goods and services. We want people to be Owners and entrepreneurs instead of users. While ownership requires responsibility, like hosting an APEX environment or paying someone to do it, owners gain freedom and control over how they connect, communicate and transact.

**Core Project Principles**

1. Built for the Average Person - Blockchains can be complicated for non-techies. We want non-techies to feel comfortable integrating blockchain into their daily activities. This means a mobile-first approach and guides that walk owners through common best practices.

2. Fail Secure - Since we are dealing with people’s valuable assets we want to limit potential theft so a fail secure mentality is required. This approach must be coupled with secure backup and recovery processes to minimize the potential for loss.

3. Identity not Anonymity - Identity is fundamental to secure transactions. If you can’t properly identify and authenticate the people and services you want to interact and transact with then you can’t be secure. There are many valid reasons for anonymity online but we believe a strong assertion of identity coupled with privacy through encryption is the best path for securely connecting, communicating and transacting.

4. Transparent Key Management - The average person has no idea how to properly secure the private keys that control their digital assets so they shouldn’t be expected to. The APEX Universal Wallet (Au Wallet) is designed to make key management simple, secure and transparent for Owners.

5. Protean Security - Common security practices can create a static attack surface for hackers and bad actors. APEX is designed to leverage asymmetric key cryptography with every entity performing key exchanges with their connections. These exchanges are performed transparently and keys are regularly rotated creating a constantly evolving attack surface.

6. No Censorship - We believe in free will. Owners have the ultimate control over who they connect, communicate and transact with as well as what they choose to share with others. This doesn’t mean that we endorse anything people want to share, but we fully support their right to free speech. APEX is a powerful platform leveraging modern security primitives to provide privacy through encryption with no centralized mechanisms to prevent or prohibit speech. Having said that, APEX does create an immutable record of most activities so while illegal activities will be obfuscated via encryption they can be completely reconstructed by someone with the appropriate keys. We don’t want to police what Owners do, but this doesn’t mean there can’t be consequences for bad behavior.

**Ownership Maturity Based on Project Roadmap**

We see Ownership as a continuum that Owners move across as their needs evolve. AnyChain has broken down Ownership Maturity into 4 stages that also track to our project roadmap.

Stage 1: **Personal Ownership** - Making ownership simple and secure for the average person. The focus for Personal Ownership is what does an individual need in order to interact and transact on a 1 to 1 basis? This means Wallet services for payment processing, sending payments and storing value leveraging any supported blockchain. It also includes Connection and Content services to facilitate secure interactions and easy monetization of digital content. This stage provides the foundation for future capabilities and represents the APEX v1.0 release.

Stage 2: **Community Ownership** - Building on stage 1, Community Ownership is all about building and maintaining communities with shared ownership and control. This stage includes channels for public or private group conversations, event planning/scheduling/ticketing and support for group ownership through multisig wallets.

Stage 3: **Merchant Ownership** - No more side hustles, APEX is how your small business gets paid. Merchant Ownership means providing support for inventory, invoicing, shipping and tracking of physical goods and services. The goal for this stage is to enable in-person or online shopping with APEX acting as the point of sale system.

Stage 4: **Builder Ownership** - This stage empowers Owners to share their expertise with other Owners. As a Builder, you are creating new experiences for Owners. This includes creating guides (best practices) that walk Owners through common activities, adding new activities (APIs) and even creating wholly new APEX services.

**Join us!**

AnyChain aims to elevate and empower Owners to be their best and achieve their dreams. We believe the best way to accomplish this is through simple yet secure technology geared towards economic activity. We hope that you are as excited over the benefits of ownership as we are. Please join us on this journey to empower people to be their best through economic freedom.
