## Intoduction
The premise of a AnyChain Personal Exchange (APEX) is simple: Empower owners to connect, communicate and transact with blockchains, owners and services on THEIR terms. APEX enables owners to integrate blockchains with their other daily activities so they can earn, spend and store value as they see fit. Personal Exchanges provide the “plumbing” required to allow an owner to easily monetize their labor, physical goods and digital assets.
